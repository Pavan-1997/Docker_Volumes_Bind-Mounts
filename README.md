## Docker Volumes

It is a very common requirement to persist the data in a Docker container beyond the lifetime of the container. However, the file system of a Docker container is deleted/removed when the container dies.

There are 2 different ways how docker solves this problem.

- Volumes
- Bind Directory on a host as a Mount

Volumes aims to solve the same problem by providing a way to store data on the host file system, separate from the container's file system, so that the data can persist even if the container is deleted and recreated.

Volumes can be created and managed using the docker volume command. You can create a new volume using the following command:

```
docker volume create <volume_name>
```

Once a volume is created, you can mount it to a container using the -v or --mount option when running a docker run command. 

```
docker run -it -v <volume_name>:/data <image_name> /bin/bash
```

Below are a few more commands related to docker volumes

	1. docker volume ls 
	(To view all volumes)
	2. docker volume create pavan
	(Logical filesystem/partition on Host)
	3. docker volume inspect pavan
	(To get details of specific volume)
	4. docker volume rm pavan
	(Delete pavan volume created earlier)
	5. docker run -d â€”mount source=pavan,target=/app <image-name>
(Attach mount to a docker container)

This command will mount the volume <volume_name> to the /data directory in the container. Any data written to the /data directory
inside the container will be persisted in the volume on the host file system.
